# Cline Rules for SubPirate

## Project-Specific Patterns

### 1. Image Handling
- When displaying images from Reddit (or any external source), always use the `RedditImage` component
- Never directly use the `<img>` tag for external resources, especially from Reddit
- Always provide a fallback image or let the component generate a placeholder
- Use lazy loading for all images to improve performance

### 2. Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for all async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Include context in error messages (what was being attempted)
- Log detailed information for debugging
- Use consistent error handling patterns across the application

### 3. API Interactions
- Be cautious of Reddit API rate limits
- Use proper error handling for API calls
- Implement retries for transient failures
- Cache results where appropriate to reduce API usage

### 4. Component Structure
- Use presentational/container separation
- Use custom hooks for complex logic
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props

### 5. Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the app's dark theme color scheme
- Use the app's accent color (#C69B7B) for interactive elements
- Use consistent spacing and padding

### 6. User Experience
- Provide feedback for all user actions
- Show loading states for async operations
- Implement proper error recovery
- Ensure smooth transitions between states

### 7. State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Use context for shared state
- Minimize prop drilling
- Use optimistic updates for improved UX

### 8. Testing
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Test edge cases and error states
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

### 9. Stripe Integration
- Always check both build environment AND domain name when determining production mode
- Never hardcode test mode flags - use environment detection
- Use different environment variables for test vs. production API keys
- Verify webhook endpoint configuration before deploying to production
- Log detailed information about the current environment for debugging
- Run verification script before production deployment
- Handle test mode in UI with clear visual indicators
- Implement comprehensive error handling for payment failures
- Never commit actual API keys to the repository

## Project Preferences

### 1. Code Style
- Use functional components
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use destructuring for props and state

### 2. File Organization
- Group related files by feature
- Use index files for exporting
- Keep file sizes manageable
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 3. Documentation
- Document complex functions
- Include examples where helpful
- Document state management patterns
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### 4. Performance
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize renders with useCallback and useMemo
- Monitor and optimize bundle size

### 5. Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure proper contrast
- Support keyboard navigation

### 6. Environment Configuration
- Use separate .env files for development and production
- Clearly differentiate between test and production API keys
- Follow environment-specific logging patterns
- Include verification steps in deployment process
- Document required environment variables for each environment
- Use domain and build-based environment detection for third-party services
